execute ! RUN GAME to run the game (obviously).
if you run RUN GAME and python is not installed it will try to download python and close. run it again to see if it installed. 

you should be already playing the game by running the main file (RUN GAME) 2 times. if you're not, download python.
first time running may take a while to open (cuz i cant code anything other than python)
